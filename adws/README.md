# AI Developer Workflows (ADWs)

This directory contains AI Developer Workflow templates used throughout the development of this project.

## Workflow Pattern: Plan → Build → Test

Each feature implementation follows this structured approach:

### 1. Plan Phase
- Analyze requirements from GitHub issues
- Design component architecture
- Identify dependencies and edge cases
- Create implementation plan

### 2. Build Phase
- Implement features following the plan
- Write clean, type-safe TypeScript code
- Apply Tailwind CSS styling
- Follow Next.js best practices

### 3. Test Phase
- Manual testing of functionality
- Verify responsive design
- Check for edge cases
- Validate win/draw conditions

## Usage with Agents

Workflows in this directory are executed by autonomous agents using slash commands:
- `/feature` - Implement new features
- `/implement` - Build specific functionality
- `/chore` - Maintenance tasks
- `/fix` - Bug fixes

## Workflow Templates

Templates will be added as development progresses, documenting:
- Game logic implementation
- UI component creation
- State management setup
- Deployment configuration
