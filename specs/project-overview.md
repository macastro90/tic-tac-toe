- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Development Approach
This project demonstrates end-to-end development using autonomous agents following the **plan → build → test** workflow.

### Agentic Layer Structure
- `.claude/commands/` - Custom Claude commands for development tasks
- `adws/` - AI Developer Workflow templates
- `specs/` - Project specifications and requirements

## Core Features

2. Two-player gameplay (X and O)
3. Win detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
4. Draw detection
5. Game reset functionality
6. Score tracking
7. Responsive design

## Development Workflow
All features will be implemented through:
1. GitHub Issues describing functionality
2. AI Developer Workflows (ADWs) or slash commands
3. Autonomous agent execution
4. Pull requests with agent-generated commits
